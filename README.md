# CRSF-joystick

A very basic Teensy 3.x HID joystick for the CrossFire protocol.

Be sure to set the baud rate of your receiver to 115200, you can do this with ExpressLRS by setting RCVR_UART_BAUD=115200.

By default it just reports 5V and 100% battery using telemetry to stop my radio from yelling at me :)
